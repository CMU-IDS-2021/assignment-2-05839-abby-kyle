## Abstract

The Shape of Belief

Beliefs are one of the most important things in human life. They determine the way we think; how we act; who we are. In the history of human endeavor, few belief systems have exerted a greater impact on our collective consciousness than religious faith. Many of our traditions date back millennia and have evolved symbiotically with us through the years, simultaneously shaping and being shaped by our collective will. 

In this project, we examine the results of The Pew Research Center's [2014 Religious Landscape Survey](https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) to get a small glimpse into religious belief in the United States and its ongoing confrontation with modernity.

## Project Goals

_Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals._

TODO

## Design

_How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?_

Below, we break down the design for each of the component visualizations we constructed for our project.

**The Geography of Belief**

In this interactive visualization we seek to create a way to easily explore the distribution of religious beliefs in the United States.

**How Our Beliefs Shape Us**

In this interactive visualization we seek to discover the manner in which religious faith, as measured by the various metrics and questions present in the Pew survey, change with various variables in human life.

**How Our Beliefs Evolve**

In this interactive visualization we seek to discover the ways in which our religious faith correlates with other belief systems.

**The Shape of our Future Beliefs**

In this interactive visualization we seek to hypothesize what the future distribution of religious belief might look like in the United States. This visualization is based on [analysis performed by Leah Libresco](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/evangelical-protestants-are-the-biggest-winners-when-people-change-faiths/) from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). In Ms. Libresco's original work, she computes a transition matrix that encodes the rates of transition between various religious faiths based on the results of the most recent Pew Research study as well as previous iterations. Here, we utilize this transition matrix to project possible future proportions of religious adherents. It is important to note, however, that this analysis is relatively simple, and lacks much of the complex modeling of social dynamics that would likely be required to make projections such as this one with any degree of long-term accuracy.

## Development

_Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?_
