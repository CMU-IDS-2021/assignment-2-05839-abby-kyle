## Abstract

The Shape of Belief

Beliefs are one of the most important things in human life. They determine the way we think; how we act; who we are. In the history of human endeavor, few belief systems have exerted a greater impact on our collective consciousness than religious faith. Many of our traditions date back millennia and have evolved symbiotically with us through the years, simultaneously shaping and being shaped by our collective will. 

In this project, we examine the results of The Pew Research Center's [2014 Religious Landscape Survey](https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) to get a small glimpse into religious belief in the United States and its ongoing confrontation with modernity.

## Project Goals

_Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals._

TODO

## Design

_How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?_

Below, we break down the design for each of the component visualizations we constructed for our project.

**The Geography of Belief**

In this interactive visualization we seek to create a way to easily explore the distribution of religious beliefs in the United States.

**How Beliefs Change with Us**

In this interactive visualization we seek to discover the manner in which religious faith, as measured by the various metrics and questions present in the Pew survey, change with various variables in human life.

**How Beliefs Shape Us**

In this interactive visualization we seek to discover the ways in which our religious faith correlates with other belief systems.
